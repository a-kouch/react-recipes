                <p>My name is Anthony and I am a home cook who developed a passion for cooking while working in a Japanese fine dining restaurant.
                While my favourite cuisine is Japanese, I have delved into many other cuisines and cooking styles as I like to cook for both myself and my partner.

                <p>
                In my pursuit into a programming career, I created this website as a place to host my recipes for both easy access for me and my partner.
